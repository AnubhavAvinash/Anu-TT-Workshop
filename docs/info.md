## How it works

NOT gate connects input 1 to output 1

## How to test

Set the inputs and check the outputs match with the expected results:

|input a | output NOT |
|--------|------------|
| 0      | 1          |
| 1      | 0          |

Set the clock to 10kHz and the first output should be on when the input is 0 and it should be off when the input is 1
## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
